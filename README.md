# spotify
An exploratory analysis of Spotify and Youtube data for music.
Full Disclosure: This project was made as a part of my Introduction to Regression Analysis class with a partner. I have removed their name from the project.
This dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube
And was not made by me. This project has a goal of some sorts, though I wouldn't say its the most important for most people.
We also edited this dataset for the purpose of the project mostly by removing many of the rows as we thought SAS couldn't really handle that many rows very well, we were wrong and probably shouldn't have removed those rows, though I don't necessarily think it was a bad idea as it allowed us to focus on the most popular songs rather than just any songs.
